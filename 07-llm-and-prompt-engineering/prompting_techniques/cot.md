Solve the following math problem step by step:

Problem: A bakery sells 15 cupcakes in the morning and 20 cupcakes in the afternoon. Each cupcake costs $2. How much money did the bakery make in total?

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cupcakes sold.
- Morning cupcakes: 15
- Afternoon cupcakes: 20
- Total cupcakes sold = 15 + 20 = 35

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue.
- Price per cupcake: $2
- Total revenue = Total cupcakes sold * Price per cupcake
- Total revenue = 35 * 2 = $70

Final Answer: The bakery made $70 in total.
### Example 1:

**Solve the following math problem step by step:**

**Problem:** A car travels 60 miles in 2 hours. What is the car's average speed in miles per hour?

**Step 1:** Identify the formula for average speed.  
- Formula: Average speed = Total distance traveled ÷ Total time taken  

**Step 2:** Substitute the given values into the formula.  
- Total distance traveled: 60 miles  
- Total time taken: 2 hours  
- Average speed = 60 ÷ 2 = 30  

**Final Answer:** The car's average speed is **30 miles per hour**.

### Example 2:

**Solve the following math problem step by step:**

**Problem:** Sarah buys 3 notebooks for $4 each and 2 pens for $1.50 each. How much money does Sarah spend in total?  

**Step 1:** Calculate the total cost of the notebooks.  
- Cost per notebook: $4  
- Number of notebooks: 3  
- Total cost of notebooks = 4 × 3 = $12  

**Step 2:** Calculate the total cost of the pens.  
- Cost per pen: $1.50  
- Number of pens: 2  
- Total cost of pens = 1.50 × 2 = $3  

**Step 3:** Add the costs of the notebooks and pens to find the total expenditure.  
- Total expenditure = Cost of notebooks + Cost of pens  
- Total expenditure = $12 + $3 = $15  

**Final Answer:** Sarah spends **$15** in total.

### Example 3:

**Problem:** A train leaves Station A at 8:00 AM, traveling at a speed of 60 mph. Another train leaves Station A at 10:00 AM, traveling at a speed of 90 mph in the same direction. At what time will the second train catch up to the first train?

**Step 1:** Calculate the head start of the first train.  
- Time difference: 10:00 AM - 8:00 AM = 2 hours  
- Distance covered by the first train in 2 hours = Speed × Time = 60 × 2 = 120 miles  

**Step 2:** Find the relative speed of the second train compared to the first train.  
- Relative speed = Speed of second train - Speed of first train = 90 - 60 = 30 mph  

**Step 3:** Calculate the time it takes for the second train to catch up.  
- Time = Distance ÷ Relative speed = 120 ÷ 30 = 4 hours  

**Step 4:** Determine the time when the second train catches up.  
- Catch-up time = 10:00 AM + 4 hours = 2:00 PM  

**Final Answer:** The second train will catch up to the first train at **2:00 PM**.

### Example 4:

**Problem:** A farmer has 10 chickens and 5 cows. If each chicken lays 2 eggs per day and each cow produces 3 liters of milk per day, how many eggs and liters of milk does the farmer get in 7 days?

**Step 1:** Calculate the total eggs laid by the chickens in 1 day.  
- Eggs per chicken per day: 2  
- Total eggs per day = Number of chickens × Eggs per chicken = 10 × 2 = 20  

**Step 2:** Calculate the total eggs in 7 days.  
- Total eggs in 7 days = Eggs per day × 7 = 20 × 7 = 140  

**Step 3:** Calculate the total milk produced by the cows in 1 day.  
- Milk per cow per day: 3 liters  
- Total milk per day = Number of cows × Milk per cow = 5 × 3 = 15 liters  

**Step 4:** Calculate the total milk in 7 days.  
- Total milk in 7 days = Milk per day × 7 = 15 × 7 = 105 liters  

**Final Answer:** The farmer gets **140 eggs** and **105 liters of milk** in 7 days.

### Example 5:

**Problem:** A bookshelf has 3 rows, each with 15 books. If 5 books are removed from each row, how many books are left on the bookshelf?

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of books on the bookshelf initially.  
- Books per row: 15  
- Total rows: 3  
- Total books = Books per row × Total rows = 15 × 3 = 45  

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of books removed.  
- Books removed per row: 5  
- Total books removed = Books removed per row × Total rows = 5 × 3 = 15  

**Step 3:** Subtract the removed books from the total.  
- Remaining books = Total books - Total books removed = 45 - 15 = 30  

**Final Answer:** There are **30 books** left on the bookshelf.
