Key Concepts and DSA Explanations
Graph Data Structure:

The state graph represents nodes (step_1, human_feedback, step_3) and edges (START, END, transitions).
Each node corresponds to a step or a function.
Edges define the workflow between these steps.
State Management:

The State TypedDict acts as a structure to store input and feedback data, ensuring type safety and clarity.
The MemorySaver helps in checkpointing to save progress and resume later.
Interrupt Handling:

Uses interrupt to simulate a pause in execution for external human input.
This allows dynamic intervention during the automated workflow, crucial in agentic AI systems.
Resuming Execution:

After interruption, the graph resumes execution from a specific step (human_feedback in this case).
The Command(resume="...") ensures the graph continues seamlessly.
Real-World Application:

The state graph can model workflows in chatbots, automation systems, or decision-making engines, with interruptions for human feedback enabling refinement.
