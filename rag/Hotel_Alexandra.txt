Welcome to a Time Capsule of Mid-Century Danish Design Probably the hotel with the largest collection of Danish vintage design furniture in the world. 20 years ago, we started collecting classic Danish furniture. Our aim was to build a collection representing the foremost Danish designers but also representing different works of each individual designer. We succeeded in doing this, and today we can offer our guests a large selection of rooms and suites dedicated to the great Danish designers. – Jeppe Mühlhausen, General Manager. The first room you enter when you arrive at Hotel Alexandra is, of course, the lobby which is why we have put a great amount of work into making it as welcoming as possible. We aim to make the atmosphere calm, warm, and comfortable, or as we would say in Danish ‘hyggelig’. We have tried to activate your senses by playing music, at times from the old B&O vinyl record player, and by making it visually inviting with some of the greatest Danish design classics. We want you to feel the texture and comfort of these pieces of furniture in order to create an authentic experience that you will remember.

At Hotel Alexandra you will find Danish design classics in the hallways and in the rooms. We believe that this is the greatest way to pay tribute to the masterminds behind them. Some of the people we consider masterminds are: Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl, Nanna Ditzel, Jens Risom, Ole Wanscher, Hans J. Wegner, and Børge Mogensen and our Double Rooms de Luxe are dedicated to each of them individually. The period from 1940s to 1970s was especially important and productive in the development of Danish design. At Hotel Alexandra we have dedicated all the single- and double rooms to the 50s-60s. Only one room at the hotel is fully dedicated to the hippie style of the 70s. You might be thinking: ‘wait someone is missing’, and yes, you are right. It is hard to pick one favourite designer but the most untraditional, most colourful and dare we say most exciting, is the extraordinary genius Verner Panton. His talent deserves no less than its own suite which is colourful, untraditional, and exciting. Nanna Ditzel Nanna Ditzel was born in 1923 in Copenhagen, and before studying at the School of Arts and Crafts and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, she trained as a cabinetmaker. In 1968 Nanna Ditzel moved to London with her husband Kurt Heide, where they gained international appreciation with their design studio.Ditzel’s designs are characterised by gracefulness and elegance. They have a sculptural expression and are at the same time comfortable to sit in. Rarely are these two qualities united in one and the same design. Her work is often referred to as modern and progressive with furniture created in polyester and glass fibre. Nanna Ditzel was convinced that chairs should not only compliment the room but also the person sitting in it. She has also designed textiles and jewellery for Georg Jensen, and she co-wrote the book, ‘Danish Chairs’ published in 1954. Kai Kristiansen The Kai Kristiansen room is presenting a selection of his finest furniture. Kai Kristiansen started his career in the 1950s, a time when Danish modern furniture was highly popular both in Denmark and internationally. Kai Kristiansen, born in 1929, grew up in the North of Jutland and was taught as a craftsman in carpentry and cabinet-making. In 1951 he moved to Copenhagen to attend Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, just as Nanna Ditzel. He studied under the direction of famous furniture designer, Kaare Klint. This meeting and the principles developed by Klint became crucial for Kristiansen’s future work and design approach. ‘Economy, ecology, and common sense’ became the motto for Kristiansen who decided to move back to Jutland to pursue his career in a region and culture he knew well. With the training both as a craftsman and as a designer, his innovative approach and modest yet straightforward character made him popular amongst furniture makers seeking to revise their furniture collection.

An Interview with Jeppe Mühlhausen: Hotel Alexandra is like a museum where you can stay and experience the history of Danish mid-century- and Danish Modern design. With its large collection of world-famous Danish mid-century vintage furniture and its uniquely decorated 61 rooms, Hotel Alexandra offers the opportunity to experience Danish design culture up close. I do not think anyone can tell us about Hotel Alexandra better than Jeppe Mühlhausen, who has been working at Hotel Alexandra for nearly 30 years. To learn more about Hotel Alexandra and Danish Design Culture, I asked Jeppe Mühlhausen, General Manager at Hotel Alexandra. We have a great passion for creating memorable experiences for our guests I believe that the greatest tribute we can pay the great Danish designers, is to use and keep using the furniture. Before we start talking about Hotel Alexandra, could you tell us about yourself ? I have been working at Hotel Alexandra for 27 years now, which is most of my adult life. During my childhood I would spend a lot of my free time with my grandfather, who was head of the exhibitions at Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. Danish Design classics were a part of our home growing up. In other words, I have had the honour of being surrounded by art and design most of my life. I am in no doubt that this is part of the reason why I do what I do now and I do it with great passion. Hotel Alexandra is looking like a Modern Danish Furniture Museum, so you have to feel like a museum director. How does it feel to manage a hotel like that of a museum and carry all of these artefacts conservation responsibilities? I believe that the greatest tribute we can pay the great Danish designers is to use, and keep using the furniture. The quality of the classics is so good that we rarely have to do anything to repair and maintain the shape of them. Could you tell us about Hotel Alexandra and the overall concept? Hotel Alexandra is a small boutique hotel in Copenhagen with a large collection of world-famous Danish mid-century vintage furniture. Our 61 rooms are all individually decorated. We have a great passion for creating memorable experiences for our guests and for sharing our knowledge and excitement for Danish mid-century design and Danish Modern design.What type of different rooms and suites do you offer to your guests? Could you tell us about your rooms and suites? What are their features? Our standard rooms are themed in either 50s or 60s Danish vintage style. Our De Luxe rooms are with furniture and textiles, a tribute to some of the greatest mid-century Designers: Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl, Nanna Ditzel, Jens Risom, Børge Mogensen, Hans J. Wegner, and Ole Wanscher. Last but not least our Verner Panton Suite, which is our boldest room with an orange living room, pink entrance, blue bathroom, and purple bedroom. Please tell us about your services and amenities. How could your guests spend time at Hotel Alexandra? We have a lobby made for our guests to relax. There is a library where you can immerse yourself and learn more about Danish Design. In the evening we offer our guests a complimentary glass of wine to enjoy in the lobby where you can put on your favourite LP on our vintage B&O vinyl record player. Where is Hotel Alexandra situated? What can your guests do when they step out of the Hotel Alexandra and into the streets of Copenhagen? My colleagues and I have made an app with recommendations on what to do based on the fact that more and more guests are seeking to experience Copenhagen like locals. These recommendations reflect what we like to do in our spare time and it is updated regularly to keep it relevant. The app is called ‘Hotel Alexandra Copenhagen’. What kind of additional services do you offer business travellers? All our rooms have a working desk, tea, and coffee making facilities, and good Wi-Fi. Which is the top season for travellers who want to visit Copenhagen? And why is the reason? Summer time in Copenhagen is incredible. I believe that this is due to the rough and dark winters in Denmark that make us stay inside for 4 months. Every time the sun and warmth hit the city, everybody gathers outside in every available space to be together, drink wine, dine and laugh. The beauty of Denmark and other Nordic countries is the very contrasting seasons. Copenhagen can feel like four different wonderful cities changing depending on the season.
What are the most famous attractions near you? We are situated 5 minutes from Tivoli, the City Hall Square, The Central Station, and the main shopping street. Through our guests’ reviews, we have learned that our location is one of the things they really appreciate about staying with us. If you only have one weekend in Copenhagen and are a first-time visitor, what are the best things to do in this limited time? The very first thing I would recommend you to do is to rent a bicycle for the entire weekend, which is the easiest, cheapest, and fastest way to get around. Then I would recommend you to eat at as many different places as possible, as Copenhagen is packed with magnificent eating places at all price levels, styles, sizes, and shapes. To get the most authentic experience, I would recommend first-time visitors to visit Nørrebro, Vesterbro, and Christianshavn. In addition to this, I would recommend everyone staying in Copenhagen to download our app for more specific recommendations. The website ‘Visit Copenhagen’ also has a lot of good articles and tips on what to do in- and around Copenhagen. How do you describe Copenhagen in one sentence? It is a perfectly liveable and wonderful city with room for everybody and part of the top five happiest people in the World.Welcome to a universe of female masters: The interior design of room 560 takes inspiration from some of the greatest Danish female designers. The design is a tribute to the Danish female designers from the Golden Era of Danish design. The Arne Jacobsen Room at Hotel Alexandra Arne Jacobsen is famous for an incredible span of designs, not only was he an excellent furniture designer but also a phenomenal architect. His international reputation as one of the greatest architects of his time has long been established. He drew the National Bank of Denmark located in Copenhagen among other buildings. If a building becomes architecture, then it is art. Women from the so called ‘Golden Era’ are often forgotten among the many male designers and architects. This room creates a stylish and powerful space, where the furniture can radiate the power of the women behind it. We have drawn inspiration from the slick SAS-stewardess uniforms and the Vilhelm Lauritzen airport terminal. We look back to a time where women became business women in a male dominated architect world and where the pursuit of ratifying the Danish female designers as equals to all the great male designers of the time. Nanna Ditzel’s designs range from the surrealistic to the exceedingly simple. She began her work in the late 1940s and worked through the 1990s, continuing to exhibit and win awards until her death in 2005. Architect MAA, designer, and Professor Bodil Kjær has worked with some of the most prominent names in architecture and design during her career, including Arne Jacobsen. In addition to working with renowned designers and architects from around the world, Bodil Kjær has also managed to create a name for herself. The Q- junior suite features the hotel’s largest bathroom, which gives plenty of reason to relax and to treat yourself. The tiles and colours have been carefully selected to reflect the time and ambiance like the rest of the room. The impressions from the colours, furniture and details are vast; the room greets you from every angle possible. We suggest you start by putting yourself into the Oda chair, use the armrest, exhale, and take a minute to look around and appreciate this unique and beautiful room. We would like to pay a special tribute to two amazing women: the architect, Merete Breaa, and the scenographer, Camilla BjørnW J vad. These two women have played a big role in the execution of this extraordinary room. They are the dynamic duo and the creative brain behind the whole project. Design classics from Danish female designers

The Colourful Rebel Our 1960s rooms represent the graphic colour expressions and geometric patterns for which the Danish designer Verner Panton became famous. One sits more comfortably on a colour that one likes. -Verner Panton trong graphic elements are widely used for home decoration, typically in black and white or with simple colour contrasts. Wooden furniture and ceramics are gradually supplemented with home accessories in glass and metal. Verner Panton worked for Arne Jacobsen until 1955 where he started his own design and drawing studio. He was an international modernist like Arne Jacobsen but with a touch of pop-culture. He was one of the few Scandinavian designers that broke with the tradition of producing hand-crafted wooden furniture. Verner Panton was untraditional and playful, and his interiors were meant to support creativity and human interaction. You can experience Panton’s psychedelic colour scheme, shapes, and patterns in the lounge just next to the lobby and in the Panton suite on the fifth floor. In the following paragraphs are some of our favourite quotes from Verner Panton that give an insight into the philosophy that made him work the way he did: ‘The main purpose of my work is to provoke people into using their imagination. Most people spend their lives in dreary, grey-beige conformity, mortally afraid of using colours. By experimenting with lighting, colours, textiles, and furniture and utilising the latest technologies, I try to show new ways to encourage people to use their fantasy and make their surroundings more exciting.’ Verner Panton As you probably know already, or can read from these quotes, Panton’s designs are all about colours, which is why the entrance of the Panton Suite is painted in a solid pink colour, the lounge and living room in a fierce orange and the bedroom in a deep blue or purple depending on the eyes that see it.

It is easy to explore all of Copenhagen on bike from Hotel Alexandra. Our high-quality bikes can be rented at the reception.

Jens Risom room at Hotel Alexandra — Copenhagen, Denmark: It’s no secret we’re big fans of Jens Risom here at Wallpaper*. While the late Danish designer has achieved iconic status in the US where he spent most of his career, he has been somewhat forgotten in Denmark, where he went to school with the likes of Hans Christian Wegner and Børge Mogensen. With the opening of the Jens Risom room at the Hotel Alexandra, in what perhaps is Copenhagen’s cosiest  (or as we say in Danish, hyggelig) place to stay, design promotion company Form Portfolios, who are bringing Risom's legacy back to life, are hoping to stir interest in the late designer in his country of birth. The room is furnished with a cornucopia of some of Risom's most iconic pieces including the U-151 sofa; T710 side table; and the small T539 magazine table. Some of these are still in production today, while some have been bought vintage especially for the project. The hotel’s general manager, Jeppe Mühlhausen says his favourite is the 654 chair designed for Knoll in 1942. ‘The chair is made from wood and rejected parachute straps due to war material restrictions. I think this piece is so elegant and somehow warm at the same time.

Arne Jacobsen room. The Arne Jacobsen room is for us a very unique room. As a tribute to Arne Jacobsen we have furnished this particular room with a selection of his fine furniture and textiles. Arne Jacobsen’s international reputation as one of the greatest architects of his time has long been established. He was famous for an incredible span of designs. Many of the large buildings he furnished were an all-inclusive design, including everything from furniture and textiles to silverware and ashtrays. Arne Jacobsen developed unique furniture models to furnish his own buildings. For example, he designed the Egg and the Swan for the SAS Royal Hotel in 1958-60, while his highbacked Oxford chair from 1961 was designed for an English college. In each instance, the assignment was completed as part of an overall architectural solution with a rare concordance between the building and design.
